DOCUMENT

A Document represents an entire XML document, including its constituent elements, attributes, processing instructions, comments etc. Remember that it inherits properties from Node.

Document.documentElement

    The one and only root element of the document.

Document.getElementsByTagName(tagName)

    Search for all descendants (direct children, children’s children, etc.) with a particular element type name.

Document.getElementsByTagNameNS(namespaceURI, localName)

    Search for all descendants (direct children, children’s children, etc.) with a particular namespace URI and localname. The localname is the part of the namespace after the prefix.

ELEMENT

Element is a subclass of Node, so inherits all the attributes of that class.

Element.tagName

    The element type name. In a namespace-using document it may have colons in it. The value is a string.

Element.getElementsByTagName(tagName)

    Same as equivalent method in the Document class.

Element.getElementsByTagNameNS(namespaceURI, localName)

    Same as equivalent method in the Document class.

Element.hasAttribute(name)

    Returns true if the element has an attribute named by name.

Element.hasAttributeNS(namespaceURI, localName)

    Returns true if the element has an attribute named by namespaceURI and localName.

Element.getAttribute(name)

    Return the value of the attribute named by name as a string. If no such attribute exists, an empty string is returned, as if the attribute had no value.

Element.getAttributeNode(attrname)

    Return the Attr node for the attribute named by attrname.

Element.getAttributeNS(namespaceURI, localName)

    Return the value of the attribute named by namespaceURI and localName as a string. If no such attribute exists, an empty string is returned, as if the attribute had no value.

Element.getAttributeNodeNS(namespaceURI, localName)

    Return an attribute value as a node, given a namespaceURI and localName.
comment

Comment represents a comment in the XML document. It is a subclass of Node, but cannot have child nodes.

Comment.data

    The content of the comment as a string. The attribute contains all characters between the leading <!-- and trailing -->, but does not include them.
